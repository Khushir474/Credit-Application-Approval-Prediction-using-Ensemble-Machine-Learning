# Credit-Application-Approval-Prediction-using-Ensemble-Machine-Learning
Overview: Forecasting credit approvals and predicting customer's credit scores  

## Case Description:

For the average American, the most common way to pay for a good or service is with a credit card; in fact, a typical American owns about 3.84 credit cards on average.  It is no wonder that the credit card industry is one of the largest financial industries in the United States, sporting a purchase volume of $10.4 trillion in 2022. As such, many of the largest banks and financial institutions in the world are consumer credit card issuers. 

From the perspective of these institutions, there are a host of factors that go into running their credit card programs, from advanced application approval models to complex rewards programs to keep loyal/profitable customers in an effort to reap profits. The ability to accurately predict how their customers will behave with their cards as well as their ability to pay their debts is fundamental to their bottom lines.
  
## Problem: 
For this project, we will aim to step into the shoes of a major credit card issuer and understand which factors correspond to what can be classified as “good” or “bad” customers.  Using this dataset, we will evaluate key factors such as likelihood of card approval and which customers are able to pay their balances off on time. We will analyze factors such as income, marital status, education, and occupation to collectively model these factors. Using this holistic analysis, we will be able to provide a deeper understanding of the approval process and which factors make a “good” and “bad” customer from the perspective of the company’s bottom line.
